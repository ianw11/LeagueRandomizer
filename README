This is a simple python script to help decide what League champion to play next.

It takes a little bit of work off the bat.  Just go into the python file and edit the champions you own and would actually play in each position.

You can pass in the index of the position you'd like if you know you want to play a specific lane and just want help deciding on the champion.  The numbers are:
   0: top
   1: mid
   2: bot (adc)
   3: support
   4: jungle


To run:
   $ python LeagueRandomizer.py [index of position]
or:
   $ python3 LeagueRandomizer.py [index of position]
